            <h1>NETD4TE Community Guidelines</h1>
            
             <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date of Last Update]</p>

            <p>Welcome to NETD4TE! Our mission is to be your "Ai Digital Wingman," creating a safe, supportive, and authentic space for making genuine connections. To ensure a positive experience for everyone, we require all users to adhere to these guidelines. Failure to do so can result in action against your account.</p>

            <h2>1. Be Authentic: Keep it Real</h2>
            <p>Trust is the foundation of any meaningful connection. We expect our users to be honest and authentic in their interactions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real Profiles Only:</strong> You must be who you say you are. Do not create fake accounts, impersonate others (including friends or public figures), or misrepresent your age, identity, or photos.</li>
                <li><strong>One Account Per Person:</strong> Each user is permitted only one account to maintain the integrity of our community.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Be Respectful: Interact with Kindness</h2>
            <p>Treat every member of the community with dignity and respect. We are a diverse platform, and we have a zero-tolerance policy for harmful behavior.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Harassment or Bullying:</strong> Do not engage in targeted abuse, shaming, bullying, or any behavior intended to make another user feel unsafe or unwelcome.</li>
                <li><strong>No Hate Speech:</strong> Content that promotes or condones violence, discrimination, or hatred against individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic is strictly prohibited.</li>
                 <li><strong>No Threats or Violence:</strong> Do not threaten anyone with harm, promote violence, or share graphically violent content.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Be Safe: Protect Yourself and Others</h2>
            <p>Your safety is our top priority. The following are strictly forbidden to protect our users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Sexual Content or Nudity:</strong> Do not send or post sexually explicit messages, photos, or any form of pornographic content.</li>
                <li><strong>No Solicitation or Spam:</strong> NETD4TE is for personal connections, not commercial activity. Do not use our platform to sell products, promote services, run scams, or drive traffic to external websites.</li>
                <li><strong>No Illegal Activities:</strong> Do not use the app to conduct or promote any illegal activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Adults Only (18+):</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to use NETD4TE. We will immediately ban any user found to be underage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>4. Our Enforcement Process</h2>
            <p>We rely on our community and our moderation team to enforce these guidelines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> If you witness any violation of these rules, please report the user's profile or message immediately. This is the fastest way to bring it to our attention. All reports are confidential.</li>
                <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> For your own peace of mind, you can block any user at any time. When you block someone, your profile will be completely hidden from them, and they will not be able to contact you.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Process:</strong> Our team reviews all reports. We may ask for evidence (like screenshots) to understand the full context.</li>
                <li><strong>Consequences:</strong> Violations can lead to a range of actions, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A formal <strong>Warning</strong>.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>Temporary Suspension</strong> of your account.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>Permanent Ban</strong> and account deletion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>False Reporting:</strong> Submitting a false or malicious report to harass another user is a violation of our guidelines. Abusing the report function will result in penalties against your own account.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thank you for helping us make NETD4TE a welcoming and safe community for everyone.</p>

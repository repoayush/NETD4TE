                <li><strong>We Have Minimal Access to Your Photos.</strong> We only ask for permission to access the specific photos you choose to upload to your profile. We cannot see or access any other photos on your device.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>To protect the safety and security of our users by preventing and addressing fraudulent or illegal activities.</li>
                <li>To provide you with customer support.</li>
                <li>To show relevant third-party advertisements (e.g., from Google AdMob) that allow us to offer certain features for free.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>

            </ul>

            <h2>6. Our Future Plans</h2>
